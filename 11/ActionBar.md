- The app bar, also known as the action bar, is one of the most important design elements in your app's activities, because it provides a visual structure and interactive elements that are familiar to users. Using the app bar makes your app consistent with other Android apps, allowing users to quickly understand how to operate your app and have a great experience. The key functions of the app bar are as follows: 

  - A dedicated space for giving your app an identity and indicating the user's location in the app. 
  - Access to important actions in a predictable way, such as search. 
  - Support for navigation and view switching (with tabs or drop-down lists).

- When you create an Activity from a template (such as Empty Template), an app bar is automatically included for the Activity.

- Each activity that uses the default theme also has an ActionBar as its app bar. Some themes also set up an ActionBar as an app bar by default. When you start an app from a template such as Empty Activity, an ActionBar appears as the app bar.
