- ScrollView

  - As a container for TextViews, ImageViews, etc.

  - Layout constraints
    - Full-screen without any margin.

- Title TextView 

  - To show the title of the article/essay.

  - Layout constraints
    - Left align the text with the left margin and the right margin.

- Author TextView 

  - To show the author of the article/essay.

  - Layout constraints
    - Left align the text with the left margin and the right margin.

- Three Paragraph TextViews

  - To show the three paragraphs of the article/essay.

  - Layout constraints
    - Left align the text with the left margin and the right margin.

- Three ImageViews 

  - To display the three images.

  - Each imageView should come after each paragraph of the article/essay.

  - Layout constraints
    - Center horizontally with the left margin and the right margin.
    - *Notice that in the previous assignment, we used a fixed size ImageView (both width and height are constants). But in this assignment, you need to implement fixed width ImageViews (width is a constant and the height will be scaled automatically to keep the aspect ratio), which means there is no padding between the imageView and the image.

- Bonus: Back to Top Button

  - To back to the top of the screen (at the beginning of the article/essay).

  - Layout constraints
    - Place the button at the lower-right corner.
