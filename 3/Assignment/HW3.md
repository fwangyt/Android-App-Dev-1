*Starter code:  



### Objectives 

- Java Object-Oriented Programming in Android Studio. 
- Debugging in Android Studio. 



### Requirements 

Download starter code, *A3_Pawprint.zip*. You are provided with an incomplete Android project (a simple inventory management app) and your task is to make it work. You need to complete **Category** class and **Item** class to run the app. 



#### Class **Category** 

1. A private instance variable of type String named **name** (10 points). 
   - With public getter and setter methods. 

2. A private instance variable of type ArrayList of **Item** named **items** (10 points). 
   - Initialize the ArrayList of **Item**.  
   - With public getter and setter methods. 

3. A public parameterized constructor (10 points). 

   - Parameter(s): one parameter of type String named **name**. 

   - Initialize the instance variable **name** inside the constructor. 

4. A public instance method named **addItem** (10 points). 

   - Parameter(s): one parameter of type **Item** named **item**. 

   - Return type: void. 

   - Add the parameter **item** into the List **items** Inside the method. 

5. A public instance method named **getItemCount** (10 points). 

   - Parameter(s): no parameter. 

   - Return type: int. 

   - Return the size of the List **items** inside the method. 

â€‹	*if you are not familiar with the ArrayList, there is a quick introduction below. 



#### Class Item 

1. A private instance variable of type String named **no** (10 points). 
   - With public getter and setter methods. 

2. A private instance variable of type String named **name** (10 points). 
   - With public getter and setter methods. 

3. A private instance variable of type double named **price** (10 points). 
   - With public getter and setter methods. 

4. A private instance variable of type int named **stock** (10 points). 
   - With public getter and setter methods. 

5. A public default constructor (5 points). 

6. A public parameterized constructor (5 points). 

   - Parameter(s): four parameters -- type string named **no**, type string named **name**, type double named **price**, and type int named **stock**. 

   - Initialize the instance variable **no/name/price/stock** inside the constructor. 



### Submission 

- Zip your Android Studio project folder and submit your .zip file via Canvas. 



### Grading 

- The assignment is based on 100 possible points. 
- Run the app with full functionality (10 bonus points).
