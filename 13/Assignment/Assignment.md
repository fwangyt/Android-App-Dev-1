## Final Project



### Overview 

You will be implementing an Android project to demonstrate all of the programming and Android app development skills you've learned throughout the course. This is a chance to work on something that is of interest to you, while also reinforcing what you've learned. 



### Timeline 

-   See Canvas. 



### Project Proposal Requirements 

Give a short description of what you plan to do for the final project. The project proposal should include app name, the purpose of your app, and proposed implementation. No more than one page in length. Submit your project proposal to Canvas as **PDF** by the due date. 



### Project Requirements 

#### Practical Application 

​	Make your app purposeful. Your app should be intended for something. For example, productivity assistance (address book, calculator, etc.), entertainment (game, music/video player, etc.), and social media (blog, chat, etc.). Think of the following mobile app categories: lifestyle, social media, utility, entertainment, productivity, and information. 

#### UI Design 

-   Fit your UI on the screen on any Android device.
    -   For example, if your UI is possibly out of the screen range on some other devices, add a NestedScrollView to your screen. Or add the gravity constraints. 
-   Make your UI look good. 
    -   For example, arrange your UI elements properly (alignment, center, etc.). Apply colors to your text if necessary (highlighted, bold, etc.). 

#### Implementation 

-   You are not required to complete 100% of target requirements/proposed implementation which are described on the proposal. However, you have to complete the key functionalities of your app. 
-   “Buggy” apps always annoyed users. Make a bug-free app is your first priority. And try to avoid any operations that could crash your app. Test your app after you finish it. 

#### Workload 

-   The minimum requirement for your project workload is double of the weekly assignment. 



### Submission 

​	Zip your Android project and submit it via Canvas.
