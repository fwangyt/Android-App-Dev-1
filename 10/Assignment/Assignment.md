- Bonus: Lowest Price Action Item (yellow star)

  ❖ When clicking on this action item, display the item that has the lowest price. 

  ❖ Don’t hard code! You need to implement a sorting to get the bonus points.

  ​	➢  It would be better to have a good structure of the data (Hint: array of HashMap). Think of the consistency concepts in 	programming.

  ​	➢  *You will lose a half of the bonus points if you simply store your data into three different arrays, sort the array that contains all prices, find the index, and use the index in the other two arrays.
